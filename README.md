To run it, run the setup file included in the package. Then you can run the GUI.
The GUI should look something like this:

### Note: The setup can only run on a 64-bit Windows version.
### To run the game on a different version, download the source code
### and run the `egg-gen.html` file. If you are not familiar with
### the game, run `instructions.html`.

### Another note: Mod features are currently experimental and
### some features (well, a lot of them) may not work.
