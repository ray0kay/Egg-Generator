To run it, run the setup file included in the package. Then you can run the GUI.
The GUI should look something like this:

###### Note: The setup can only run on a 64-bit Windows version.
###### To run the game on a different version, download the source code
###### and run the `egg-gen.html` file. If you are not familiar with
###### the game, run `instructions.html`.

###### Another note: Mod features are currently experimental and
###### some features (well, a lot of them) may not work.
