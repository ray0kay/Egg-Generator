    <h1>Egg Generator Mod Documentation</h1>
    <p>
        Please note that these docs are
        <strong><em>still under development.</em></strong> Some parts may be
        incomplete or lacking information.
    </p>
    <h2>Things Needed</h2>
    <p>
        To code a mod, you need to use a programming language called JSON. JSON is a
        language that is used to store data. It stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
       A text editor, preferably a code editor like Visual Studio Code (best code
        editor ever tbh). If you can't get a app code editor use a website editor
        like
        <a href="https://jsoneditoronline.org/#left=local.taruto" target="_blank">JSON Editor Online.</a>
        (Make sure to get rid of the existing code.) It's also really helpful if
        you also know some JSON or JS (JavaScript).
    </p>
    <h2>Actually Coding The Mod</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you have your things, you want to actually code the mod. Start by
        making a .json file. Name it anything you want, as long as it's without
        spaces. If at any time you're stuck, check the 
        <a href="exampleMod.json" target="_blank">exampleMod.json</a> file for
        examples. Type in the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="codeText">
{
    "modData": {
        "title": "My Custom Mod",
        "desc": "My First Egg-Gen Mod!"
    }
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>This code defines the title and description of your mod.</p>
    <h3>Explanation:</h3>
    <p>
        <span class="codeText">modData</span> is an object that holds the title
        and description of your mod.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Eggs</h2>
    <p>
        Now comes the fun part! It's time to add eggs! To add eggs, you need to
        add an array to the <span class="codeText">modData</span> object. The code
        should now look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="codeText">
{
    "modData": {
        "title": "My Custom Mod",
        "desc": "My First Egg-Gen Mod!"
    },
    "eggs": [
        {
            "path": "exampleMod/eggs/customEgg0.png",
            "chance": 0.5
        },
        {
            "path": "exampleMod/eggs/customEgg1.png",
            "chance": 0.5
        }
    ]
}
    </code></pre>
    Now, the <span class="codeText">eggs</span> array holds the eggs of your
    mod. Each egg is an object that has a path and a chance. The path is the
    path to the egg image and the chance is the chance of getting the egg. The
    chance is a number between 0 and 1. The formula to get the egg is it adds
    all the chances together. It then chooses a random number between 0 and
    the total chance. If the random number is less than the chance of the first egg,
    it then gives you the first egg. If not, it moves on to the next egg and adds up
    the chance of that egg. It keeps doing this until it finds an egg that matches the 
    random number. If there is a error and no selection is made, it falls back to the first egg.
